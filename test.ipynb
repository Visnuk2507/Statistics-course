    "## 1) Diabetes Mellitus – Core Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Classification\n",
    "- **Type 1 DM (T1DM):** Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β‑cells → absolute insulin deficiency.\n",
    "- **Type 2 DM (T2DM):** Combination of insulin resistance and β‑cell dysfunction → relative insulin deficiency.\n",
    "- **Other specific types:**\n",
    "  - **LADA** (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults): adult‑onset autoimmune diabetes, slower course than T1DM.\n",
    "  - **MODY** (Maturity‑Onset Diabetes of the Young): monogenic defects of β‑cell function.\n",
    "  - **Secondary causes:** pancreatic diseases (pancreatitis, trauma), endocrinopathies, drugs.\n",
    "  - **Gestational diabetes (GDM):** first recognized during pregnancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Etiology\n",
    "- **T1DM:** genetic predisposition (HLA associations) + environmental trigger (often viral) → autoimmune β‑cell destruction; autoantibodies (ICA, IAA, GAD, etc.).\n",
    "- **T2DM:** genetic susceptibility + environment → **insulin resistance** (liver, muscle, adipose) + **β‑cell failure** (impaired glucose‑stimulated insulin secretion). Strongly linked to **obesity**, physical inactivity, aging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Diagnosis (SI units)\n",
    "- **Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 7.0 mmol/L** (after ≥ 8 h fast), **or**\n",
    "- **Random plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L** with classic symptoms, **or**\n",
    "- **2‑h plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L** during 75 g OGTT, **or**\n",
    "- **HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Clinical Manifestations\n",
    "- **Hyperglycemia symptoms:** polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision, infections (e.g., candidiasis), poor wound healing.\n",
    "- **T1DM:** rapid onset; may present with **DKA**.\n",
    "- **T2DM:** insidious; often detected via complications (e.g., retinopathy) or routine screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Pathophysiology (high‑yield)\n",
    "- **T1DM:**\n",
    "  - Autoimmune destruction → >80–90% β‑cell loss before symptoms.\n",
    "  - Near‑total insulin deficiency → unopposed glucagon; ↑ hepatic glucose output; ↑ lipolysis → ketosis.\n",
    "  - “Honeymoon phase” early after diagnosis (transient partial remission).\n",
    "- **T2DM:**\n",
    "  - **Insulin resistance:** ↓ muscle glucose uptake (GLUT4), ↑ hepatic gluconeogenesis/glycogenolysis, adipose insulin resistance → ↑ lipolysis, ↑ FFA flux → worsens IR.\n",
    "  - **β‑cell dysfunction:** impaired first‑phase insulin response; glucotoxicity & lipotoxicity accelerate decline.\n",
    "  - **Incretin defect:** blunted GLP‑1 response; obesity associated with ~20% lower GLP‑1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### F. Complications\n",
    "- **Acute:**\n",
    "  - **DKA (T1> T2):** hyperglycemia, ketosis, anion‑gap metabolic acidosis, dehydration.\n",
    "  - **Hypoglycemia (both types; especially with insulin/SUs):** adrenergic + neuroglycopenic symptoms; can cause seizures/coma.\n",
    "- **Chronic:**\n",
    "  - **Microvascular:** retinopathy, nephropathy (albuminuria → CKD), neuropathies (sensory, autonomic).\n",
    "  - **Macrovascular:** atherosclerotic CVD (MI, stroke, PAD). ~75% of T2DM mortality is CVD.\n",
    "  - **Others:** infections, foot ulcers/Charcot arthropathy, erectile dysfunction, gastroparesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### G. Management (overview)\n",
    "- **Lifestyle:** medical nutrition therapy, weight loss (5–10%+), regular aerobic + resistance exercise, smoking cessation, sleep, psychosocial support.\n",
    "- **Pharmacotherapy (T2DM focus):**\n",
    "  - **Metformin** (first‑line unless contraindicated): ↓ hepatic gluconeogenesis, modest weight loss/neutral.\n",
    "  - **GLP‑1 receptor agonists** (liraglutide, semaglutide; GLP‑1/GIP duals like tirzepatide): ↓ appetite, slow gastric emptying, ↑ insulin (glucose‑dependent), ↓ glucagon → weight loss (often 10–15%+), HbA1c reduction, CV benefit (agent‑specific).\n",
    "  - **SGLT2 inhibitors:** glucosuria → ↓ glucose & weight; strong HF/CKD benefits.\n",
    "  - **DPP‑4 inhibitors:** ↑ endogenous incretins (weight neutral).\n",
    "  - **Sulfonylureas:** ↑ insulin secretion (risk: hypoglycemia, weight gain).\n",
    "  - **TZDs:** ↑ insulin sensitivity (risks: weight gain, edema, fractures).\n",
    "  - **Insulin:** required in **T1DM**; in **T2DM** when oral/GLP‑1 inadequate or acutely ill.\n",
    "- **CVD risk reduction:** BP control, statins, antiplatelet when indicated, weight management, renal protection.\n",
    "- **Foot/eye/kidney surveillance:** annual retinal exam, urine albumin/creatinine, monofilament testing.\n",

    "## 2) Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) – Describe\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Acute, life‑threatening complication due to **absolute/relative insulin deficiency** + **excess counter‑regulatory hormones** → uncontrolled lipolysis and ketogenesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Triggers:** infection, missed insulin, new‑onset T1DM, MI, stroke, pancreatitis, steroids, SGLT2i (euDKA risk), dehydration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pathophysiology:**\n",
    "- Insulin deficiency + high glucagon/epinephrine/cortisol/GH → ↑ hepatic glucose output (gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis) + ↓ peripheral uptake → **hyperglycemia**.\n",
    "- Adipose lipolysis → ↑ FFAs → hepatic β‑oxidation → **ketone bodies** (acetoacetate, β‑hydroxybutyrate) → **metabolic acidosis**.\n",
    "- Osmotic diuresis → **dehydration**, **electrolyte loss** (K⁺ total body deficit despite normal/high serum K⁺ initially).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clinical:** polyuria, polydipsia, N/V, abdominal pain, Kussmaul respirations, fruity breath, dehydration, altered mental status.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Labs:** glucose elevated (can be modest in euDKA), anion‑gap acidosis (↓ HCO₃⁻), ketonemia/ketonuria, variable K⁺.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Management (principles):**\n",
    "1) **Fluids first** (e.g., isotonic saline; adjust by hemodynamics/Na⁺).  \n",
    "2) **Insulin infusion** (after K⁺ ≥ 3.3 mmol/L) to stop ketogenesis.  \n",
    "3) **Potassium replacement** (anticipate total body deficit).  \n",
    "4) **Treat precipitant** (e.g., antibiotics for infection).  \n",
    "5) Add **dextrose** when glucose ~10–14 mmol/L to continue insulin until anion gap closes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complications to watch:** cerebral edema (esp. youth), hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, ARDS.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3) Hypoglycemia – Dangers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition (practical):** plasma glucose low enough to cause symptoms/signs; counter‑regulation begins < ~4.0 mmol/L; symptomatic often < ~3.5 mmol/L (varies).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptoms:**\n",
    "- **Autonomic (adrenergic):** tremor, palpitations, sweating, pallor, hunger, anxiety, nausea.\n",
    "- **Neuroglycopenic:** confusion, irritability, blurred/double vision, dysarthria, dizziness, seizures, coma.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dangers:**\n",
    "- **Immediate:** accidents, falls, seizures, coma, arrhythmias (QT prolongation), sudden death (\"dead‑in‑bed\" in T1DM).\n",
    "- **Impaired awareness:** repeated hypos blunt adrenergic warning symptoms → higher risk of severe events.\n",
    "- **Cognitive effects:** acute dysfunction; in children/elderly—potential long‑term cognitive impact.\n",
    "- **Social/functional:** driving/work hazards; fear of hypoglycemia → suboptimal glycemic control.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prevention/Management:** education, SMBG/CGM, individualized targets, de‑escalate sulfonylureas/insulin when appropriate, adjust for exercise/alcohol, bedtime snacks if needed, glucagon rescue, rule out contributing adrenal/thyroid dysfunction if recurrent.\n",

    "## 4) Obesity – Classification, Etiology, Pathophysiology, Risks, Management\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Classification\n",
    "- **By BMI (kg/m²):**\n",
    "  - Overweight: 25–29.9  \n",
    "  - Obesity class I: 30–34.9  \n",
    "  - Obesity class II: 35–39.9  \n",
    "  - Obesity class III: ≥ 40\n",

    "\n",
    "### B. Etiology (multifactorial)\n",
    "- **Environment/behavior:** caloric surplus, ultra‑processed foods, sedentary lifestyle, short sleep, stress.\n",
    "- **Biology:** genetic susceptibility; neurohormonal regulation of appetite/satiety (hypothalamus, leptin, GLP‑1, ghrelin, PYY); adaptive thermogenesis.\n",
    "- **Life course:** early‑onset obesity tracks into adulthood (children obese at age 2 rarely remit without intervention).\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Pathophysiology\n",
    "- **Energy balance:** intake > expenditure.\n",
    "- **Adaptive responses after weight loss:** disproportionate ↓ resting energy expenditure, ↑ skeletal muscle efficiency, ↑ hunger/cravings, ↑ sedentary time → **weight regain** common.\n",
    "- **GLP‑1 biology:** obese/overweight individuals exhibit **~20% lower GLP‑1 secretion** post‑meal (independent of glucose tolerance); contributes to impaired satiety.\n",
    "- **Insulin resistance:** excess visceral fat → adipokine dysregulation, lipotoxicity, inflammation → hepatic/muscle IR.\n",

    "### D. Risks/Complications\n",
    "- **Metabolic:** T2DM, metabolic syndrome, NAFLD/NASH, dyslipidemia, hypertension.\n",
    "- **Cardiovascular:** CAD, stroke, HF; **CVD is the leading cause of death** in T2DM.\n",
    "- **Other:** OSA, osteoarthritis, GERD, gallstones, subfertility, certain cancers, depression, stigma/reduced QoL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Management\n",
    "- **Lifestyle foundation:** calorie deficit (individualized pattern), high‑protein/high‑fiber emphasis, structured physical activity (aerobic + resistance), sleep hygiene, behavioral therapy.\n",
    "- **Pharmacotherapy:** when BMI ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 with comorbidities.\n",
    "  - **GLP‑1 RAs / dual incretins (tirzepatide):** large **12–17%** mean weight loss; also improve glycemia and CV risk factors.\n",
    "  - **Orlistat:** modest additional loss; GI side‑effects.\n",
    "- **Bariatric/metabolic surgery:** for class II–III obesity or class I with refractory comorbidities; most effective for long‑term weight and T2DM remission.\n",
    "- **Maintenance strategies:** continued exercise, ongoing pharmacotherapy (if tolerated), frequent follow‑up, relapse planning, address sedentary drift and eating behavior after weight loss.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Risks:** markedly ↑ CVD events and progression to T2DM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Management:** comprehensive risk reduction—weight loss (5–10%+), physical activity, diet quality (Mediterranean‑like), treat lipids (statins), BP control, stop smoking, consider GLP‑1 RA/SGLT2i when T2DM.\n",
